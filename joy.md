<!-- ChatGPT will give you lens flares, too. Why lens flares, I asked. "Lens flares are often associated with joy because they evoke the brightness and energy of sunlight, which is commonly linked to positive emotions like warmth, happiness, and freedom. Visually, lens flares can create a sense of liveliness and motion in an image, enhancing the dynamic quality of the scene. When used in moments that feature bright sunlight, the effect can highlight the carefree, radiant feeling often associated with joyful experiences, like playing outdoors, celebrations, or simply basking in a beautiful day." -->
